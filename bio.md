**Mike McCormick** (he/him) is an artist and programmer working with sound, text, and visual media. Equally inspired by the constrained writing techniques of the Oulipo and the technomaterialism espoused by Xenofeminism, his work often combines custom algorithms with human performers and autobiographical material to explore human intimacy, male vulnerability, and our relationship with emerging technologies. He grew up in Canadaâ€™s subarctic, lived nomadically for a decade, and has been based in Oslo since 2017.
