# _Coastline Paradox_


## mounting
- two hooks under led grid [imageGoesHere]()
- one hook for the optic fiber to hang (this should not support the majority of the piece's weight)
- cable clips to secure the USB cable to the wall


## power on/off
The piece needs to be plugged into a 220 volt wall socket to operate
Only the included white USB-A to microUSB cable with the wall adaptor should be used to power the piece
The piece should start shortly after power is delivered [videoGoesHere]()
If it does not begin after a few seconds, press the small black button on the bottom of the piece[imageOrVideoGoesHere]
A white light underneath the LED grid should turn on, and the peic

The easiest way to turn the piece on and off is to plug and unplug the wall socket
