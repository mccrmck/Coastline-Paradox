# Coastline Paradox

In my research into Norwegian lighthouses and lighthouse culture I began to consider how we represent national identity through symbols. Phallic structures like lighthouses, the Christian cross, and oil platforms have been essential features of Norway's coastal history, but how far can we abstract these symbols before we lose vital information about the places and cultures they represent?

In the same way a lighthouse's light characteristic broadcasts its location, the 160 LEDs of *Coastline Paradox* each blink a unique encoding of the name and location of a lighthouse along Norway's coast. No more than 154 lighthouses have been operational at once in Norway, and 6 inactive LEDs at the base of the cross prevent the grid from painting a complete picture of the Norwegian flag. This tiny piece presents an abstraction of the entire active lighthouse network in Norway, however: removed from its context, what could a blinking light possibly say about Norwegian identity? What about a fragmented flag? 

_[[The Coastline Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox) is a mathematical assertion that the coastline of a landmass is impossible to measure accurately as different levels of detail can always be observed at different levels of scale.]_
