## mounting
Included with the piece should be all materials needed for mounting:
- two hooks to support the [bottom of the LED grid](img/underside.jpg)
  - these should be ca. 8mm apart, on either side of the microUSB port and inside the walls of the LED grid
- one hook for the optic fiber to hang from
  - this hook should sit 10-12 cm above the top of the LED grid 
- cable clips to secure the USB cable to the wall
- the piece should sit slightly above average eye-height (ca. 190cm from the floor), inviting guests to direct their gaze slightly upward

## power on/off
The piece needs to be plugged into a 220 volt wall socket to operate. <br>
Use only the included white USB-A to microUSB cable with the wall adaptor to power the piece. <br>
The piece should start shortly after it is connected to power [videoGoesHere]() <br>
The piece is turned on and off by connecting and disconnecting it to power. <br>
Once turned on, it will run until it is turned off. <br>

**If nothing happens after a few seconds - DON'T PANIC!** <br>
Instead:
- press the small black button on the bottom of the piece, located just above the microUSB port [imageOrVideoGoesHere]()
- a white LED underneath the main LED grid should turn on, and the piece should starup shortly after



## lighting
The piece can be lit with a warm spotlight at a relatively low level <br>
