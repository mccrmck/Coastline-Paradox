# _Coastline Paradox_


## mounting
- two hooks supporting the bottom of the led grid [imageGoesHere]()
  - these should be ca. 8mm apart, on either side of the microUSB port and inside the walls of the LED grid
- one hook for the optic fiber to hang from
  - this hook should sit 10-12 cm above the top of the LED grid 
- cable clips to secure the USB cable to the wall
- the piece should sit slightly above average eye-height (ca. 190cm from the floor), inviting guests to direct their gaze slightly upward
- 


## power on/off
The piece needs to be plugged into a 220 volt wall socket to operate. <br>
Use only the included white USB-A to microUSB cable with the wall adaptor to power the piece. <br>
The piece should start shortly after it is connected to power [videoGoesHere]() <br>
**If nothing happens after a few seconds:**
- press the small black button on the bottom of the piece, located just above the microUSB port [imageOrVideoGoesHere]()
- A white LED underneath the main LED grid should turn on, and the piece should starup shortly after

The easiest way to turn the piece on and off is to connect or disconnect it from power
